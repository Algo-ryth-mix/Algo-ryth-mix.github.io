       I was born 1999 so im now 21 years old. after some mostly uneventful childhood years I visited a boarding school called <a href="https://www.werkschulheim.at">Werkschulheim Felbertal</a>.<br> I specialized in Mechatronics and especially programming, around this time my favorite programming language C++ was set.<br><br>
       
       I like to experiment with Game-Engine technologies, and optimizations. (check out some of my repos :) )<br>
       I'm easily excited with discussions about electronics, physics, mathematics and other geeky-stuff. <br>

       I know a lot of random stuff ( did you know that the scientific name for the smell of rain is petrichor ?) <br>

       Recently I discovered the beauty of hiking.
