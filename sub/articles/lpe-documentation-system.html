    <h1> LPEs new documentation system (soon &trade;) </h1>
    <p>
        Recently I discovered sphinx. No not that ancient cat in egypt, but the documentation build system python
        uses. it is quite a hassle compared to doxygen, but my do the documentation pages it generates look ever
        beautiful.<br>
        So naturally I wanted it!<br><br>

        But what gives? to use it I would have to write all my documents in .rst again or migrate libpixlengine to
        python, neither of which where easy or desireable. Breathe and Exhale to the rescue!<br><br>

        Turns out all those years of writing doxygen style comments are finally going to pay off. Breathe can
        super-charge your .rst files with doxygen-commands
        And even better exhale can generate those .rst files for you automagically! all you have to do is a bit of
        configuring... ok a lot of configuring,
        choose a theme, write some tutorials and you are set! Now for the entirety of the lpe writing this documentation
        will take me a long time and besides.
        I have recently discovered this neat thing called CI, and it would be so cool if the two could work together,
        (at least just a little)
        therefore I have for now created only a little demo. that works standalone from the LPE, but gets the point
        across quite neatly... <br>
        it looks a little like this:<br>
