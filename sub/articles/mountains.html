    <h1>Mountains!</h1>
    <p> As of the Time of this article a certain Virus by the Name of SARS-CoV-2 is making its appearance in History.
        Because of it my University is closed, which made me travel back to Austria. Now I have always been a computer-guy,
        only going into the sun when strictly necessary, but it turns out when you isolate all day you also find yourself with a lot of time on your hand. And it just so happens that Austria has a lot of Mountains, a lot more than the Netherlands at least. Now I have terrible condition, but nevertheless I took on hiking, at least a bit.
        Here is a little something from my adventures. I hope you like it!
