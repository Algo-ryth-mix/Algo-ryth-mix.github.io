    <h1>GDB Adventures</h1>
    <h3>God I love my IDE</h3>

    <p> If you are a c++ developer on linux, you are probably familiar with <code>gdb</code>. 
        Together with <code>gcc</code> (or <code>g++</code>) they are the base tools that a 
        c or c++ developer needs on linux. I have been developing for windows most of my life,
        and while I try to keep my code compatible with linux, I do not usually test it that
        thoroughly. 
    </p>

    <p>
        For the <a href="/article.html?x=articles/golang">previous</a> project in go I decided to work in linux for a change. I therfore needed to use the tools
        that are available on the platform, which was great since I already wanted to learn how to use gdb anyways.
    </p>
    <h3> Start by writing a buggy program </h3>
    <p> For the sake of brevity (and also because documenting your own debugging adventures is painful) I will create an intentionally buggy program to show a little how
        to use gdb here, but this should work the same in real life scenarios (and also in almost all compiled languages for linux)
    </p> 
    <pre class="loadcpp language-cpp" id="c++/buggy.cpp"></pre>

    <p>
        Now to be fair, this is maybe a little more than just a "typo". It is also blatently obvious, but it serves the purpose well.
        (I actually had a really hard time getting this to fail, overwriting just a single value would consistently run <i>just fine</i>)
   
        To compile this use: <br><code>g++ main.cpp -O0 -g</code><br>
        Now that we have the good old <code>a.out</code> we can verify that it
        does in fact crash:
    </p>
    <pre class="language-bash loadbash" id="outputs/buggy.out"></pre>
    <p>
        Now I'll admit that is not quite what I wanted, but still debuggable.
        to start debugging this we need to launch the application with gdb
        to do this we can run <code>gdb a.out</code> you should be dropped into a shell
        that starts with "(gdb)"
    </p>
    <h3> How do I quit <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">vim</span> gdb?</h3>
    <p>
        You'll notice that when you launch gdb nothing really happens at first. It loaded your program
        but that is about it. The most basic commands you can use right now are <code>run</code> and <code>quit</code>
        (which is conveniently also the answer to the heading of this section)<br>

        additionally you can set breakpoints, provided you know where in the source code you want to set them.
    </p>
    <p><br>
    <b>Basic crashing</b> Let us start by running the program in gbd: type <code>run</code> into the terminal.
    </p>
    <pre class="language-bash loadbash" id="outputs/gdb-crash.out"></pre>
    <p> 
        Already that is a whole lot more infomation than simply "aborted".
        It tells us where the crash happened. 3 times in fact
        <ul> 
            <li>in main()</li>
            <li>in main.cpp in line 8</li>
            <li> in the line that looks like <code>x[i] = i;</code></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        But wait, there is more!
        if you type <code>l</code> and press enter, you get a bit of an overview of the sorounding code.
        (which happens to be basically the entire program for this example).<br><br>
        <b>Getting to the root of it</b> To figure this one out we need to get a little bit of information about the local variables
        this also happens to be the command for that. <code>info locals</code> shows you the variables that we can see here.
    </p>
    <pre class="loadbash language-bash" id="outputs/locals.out"></pre>
    <p>
        With that we can easily spot the "mistake" here, clearly the array only has space for 2 elements, 
        while the iterator has already reached 1128. 
        You can also print a single variable with <code>p "variable name"</code>
        to get the size of an array you can use <code>ptype "variable name"</code>
    </p>
    <pre class="loadbash language-bash" id="outputs/p-ptype.out"></pre>
    <p> Of course modern IDEs and Editors like VS-Code have instrumentation for gdb
        making this process a whole lot more straight forward. (especially setting breakpoints
        which would normally happen with <code>break "filename":"line"</code>)

    <h3>Solving the issue</h3>
    <p> Simply increase the array to sufficent size and our problems will be gone!</p>
