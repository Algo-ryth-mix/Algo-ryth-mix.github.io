    <h1>SPACE GAME!!!</h1>
    <h3>And The Future Of Showcases</h3>
    <p>if you are visiting this website from left to right, you might have already clicked on the Tab called "Showcase". It currently shows a little game, that has no real name (which is also why the repository name of it is NoNameSpecifiedByTeam.git) But I decided to call it Space-Game for now, until my team
        finally gives the poor thing a name, and maybe beyond, since I actually kinda like the name :) If you experienced the top-notch gameplay already, and if it didn't crash on you. you might be wondering what is is for beyond just looking cool. It is a project for my study, and does actually have a client for it. in the end it should serve in the physics section of a museum. And teach you about the dangers of Space-Debris & Trash in a playful and fun way. For the nerds among my readers, it is made with Unity and C#.

        If for whatever reason you consume your content from right to left or if it crashed on you; here are some gifs!<br>

    <h3>Showcases?</h3>
    <p>
        I plan to show my more flashy and graphical accomplishments in "Showcase" from now on. I will always create a co-article with them, which you can read here on the blog. I also plan to only showcase 1 thing at the time. This has one simple reason: webgl is really, really heavy. The current unity project "Space Game", crashes very frequently, and takes ginormous amounts of memory. I do not expect this to get better, seeing as this game is still quite basic.
        However I will kind of archive them, once they are done serving in the showcase area. with a link or a download to it here in the blog. For the time being. have fun with "Space Game" :)
