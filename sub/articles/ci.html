    <h1> So you want a CI-System ? </h1>
    <p>
        Before we begin...<br>
        All of this for this measily dinky little checkmark:<br>
        <img src="media/ci.png"><br><br>

        Are you familiar with those cool badges you see on github repositories telling you about code-cov, code-quality,
        if the build is passing and so on?
        Have you ever wondered who updates these things? The answer is a "Continous Integration" - System. It turns out
        it is quite easy to add, but really hard to configure such a system, let me give you an example:
    </p>
    <pre class="language-yml loadyml " id="yml/example.yml"></pre>
    <p>
        Looks pretty tame so far doesn't it ? you can totally see how this would work with cmake, how it probably is
        pretty easy to run unit-tests in this, how you could run your application, etc...<br>
        You would probably add those steps one after the other, not to break anything and so on. Now imagine your main
        build is windows. you have a dozen dependencies, and to add insult to injury you really don't want to read
        through logs that are literal kilometers of text. Keep in mind that every build takes about 25 minutes to build
        on a system you have little to no control over. You may realize that this can get old really fast.<br><br>
        I had to do about 60 individual builds with a lot of trouble-shooting inbetween before I got the result I
        wanted. The biggest problem I had with ci was definetly one big derp, that I didn't believe I just wasted literally two
        days of work on.<br>
        take a look at this yml:
    </p>
    <pre class="language-yml loadyml" id="yml/alpine.yml"></pre>
    <p>
        Do you spot the problem ? No ?<br>
        Ok what if I also give you the output?
    </p>
    <pre class="language-bash loadbash " id="outputs/alpine.out"></pre>
    <p>
        How about now ? still no ?<br>
        Well if I took a second to actually look into the image "alpine" and took a second to look at the dependencies
        of premake, I would have solved that issue probably in under 10 hrs the issue is quite clear when you read
        through the documentation of alpine. Here is an excerpt from the main-page:<br><br>
        "Alpine Linux is a security-oriented, lightweight Linux distribution based on musl libc and busybox."<br><br>
        Musl libc hm?<br>
        What is premake5 build against again? (Like most programs) Right ... glibc. So that was a fun discovery.
        It also means that I have to use the inferior debian cloud package. I would have loved to use alpine, for it's
        lightweight-ness, but without glibc the binaries I build on this thing
        wouldn't run on anything anyways. <br><br>
        Here is the script that worked for me in the end.<br> In case you wonder what that
        DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get -yqq -o=Dpkg::Use-Pty=0 thing is,<br>
        that is just apt-get with extra steps to make it a bit less verbose
