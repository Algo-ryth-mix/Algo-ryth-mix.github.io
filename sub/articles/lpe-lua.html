    <h1> Lua Integration on LibPixlEngine </h1>
    <p>
        Working with LibPixlEngine, although I naturally get a bit blind for my pet-project, can get quite tedious.
        depending on how much code you have changed, how much of the library you are using and how powerful your rig is,
        compile times can easily surpass multiple minutes. Which, for a language like c++ where nullptrs are a thing,
        can get really old really quick. The approach most Engines choose is therefore to include some kind of scripting
        environment.<br><br> Now in LibPixlEngine this is inherently difficult because of multiple things:<br>
    </p>
    <li> LPE is highly multi-threaded. a script-environment that cannot handle that is clearly out of place.<br>
    </li>
    <li> LPE has the concept of task priorities, a script can't simply have an onEarlyUpdate() and onLateUpdate()
        method<br>
    </li>
    <li>LPE has variable frame and tick-rates, it is of utmost importance that the Script receives a DeltaTime in some
        way or another<br>
    </li>
    <li>and last but not least, LPE is ECS-based meaning you could attach a script (no matter how much sense that may
        make) to literally everything<br>
    </li>
    <br><br>
    <p>All of these things made the choice for a Scripting language really difficult, but in the end I decided to not go
        with my usual suspect(LUA), but go with the next best thing.<br>
        LUA-JIT!!<br><br>
        You might think that isn't particularly different, and you would be right, but luajit offers much better
        performance on raw scripts as it, as the name suggests,
        compiles the lua just in time. This is great as it allows me to write modules directly in lua without that big
        of a performance hit. Lua has a few other advantages as well;
        namely: It is well-established, it runs in a very minimal VM, that does not care from which thread it is being
        accessed and it can be instantiated multiple times.
        Here is a script that shows (almost) all of the features that the Environment currently supports via the Engine.
        <pre class="language-lua loadlua match-braces" id="c++/lua_interp.lua"></pre>
        <br>
        <p>As you can see the Script has full control of the underlying Component, it can also query things like the
            parent and the children,<br>
            and interact with some basic components of the engine itself, as well as construct some mathematical
            constructs.
