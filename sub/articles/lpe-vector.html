    <h1> Vectorized Libpixlengine Math Module </h1>
    <p> Recently I have been working on an improvement for the Math Module of LibPixlEngine, I decided to dwell into the
        scary world of SSE and AVX 
        once more and finally tried to improve matrix performance. For this purpose, I decided to also finally improve
        the unit-test framework of 
        lpe.unit-tests, I think I came up with an implementation that I like, that is still somewhat understandable.
        Take a look for yourself!</p>

    </br>
    <p> Now although this doesn't look like it improved the time complexity much, it is on average 10x faster, on a
        testbed with 100 4x4 matrix multiplications,
        the unoptimized approach takes on average ~1ms whilst the optimized one takes roughly ~0.1ms</p>
    <p> Now keep in mind that this takes advantage of some extensions that not all processors support, therefore we have
        to provide a fallback. 
        luckily pixl.isa.InstructionSet already has the functionality to test for SSE:</p>
