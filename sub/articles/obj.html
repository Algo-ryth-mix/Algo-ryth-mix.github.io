    <h1> Adventures into Obj Files </h1>
    <p>
        Anyone who worked with 3D models probably knows the .obj extension. it is a ubiquitous file-type that almost any
        3d Program supports.
        Support for it in LibPixlEngine is therefore important. But just as with other "ubiquitous" things, this does
        not neccessarly mean it is good.
        I really disklike the structure of how obj files work. Luckily <a
            href="https://github.com/syoyo/tinyobjloader">tinyobj</a> can do that work for me.
        Working with the structure is still a pain as there is some extra work required to get it to render, but
        overall the experience went pretty smooth.
        I would say the next step is probably materials. (maybe). Normals just ain't cutting it. Here is a small gif of
        the good old teapot.
        (note that there are indeed 2 teapots, this is not a graphical glitch, just bad spacing)<br>
