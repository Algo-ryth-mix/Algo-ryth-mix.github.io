        I have always been very much not impressed by javascript. I hate the idea of a weakly-typed multi-paradigm, event-driven, asynchronous-but-not-multi-threaded language. To me js was always this language with bad performance and weird language quirks. And it still is! But now
        I know enough of it, to not be completely lost when reading its source files.<br>

        I wrote a lot of custom javascript for this webpage, most notably amalgamate() which recombines the individual article files you see into one big monolithic master html. But since I host this webpage on github, this actually happens on your device dear reader. (sorry for stealing roughly 1 second of precious cpu cycles.) Now I am not saying this is a great solution, it is not even a good solution. but it is fast for me to mess around with and it sure is fun to steal someone elses processing power, even if it is for something so minute as to reassemble a webpage. Think about it, it kinda is as if I were to walk into a library and instead of getting a book, I get the individual pages and a stick of glue.<br>
        Here is the offending piece of code. Note this also makes the webpage not load if you disallow javascript.
