    <h1>Reworking my Portfolio</h1>
    <p>If you visited my portfolio before, you might have noticed that this looks drastically different than before, if you are wondering why, the gist of it is; I simply didn't like the way my portfolio looked before, the fonts where hard to read, there was a tonne of uneccessary information, and overall the one-page design simply did not work out. also I made a deal with devil, and was finally gonna learn some js.<br><br>
    Now I am not a web-dev, nor have I any experience in front-end, I simply go by what looks good and by what little feedback I get from my fellow engineer-friends, but I put as much engineery nerdy stuff into here as possible. If not impressive in a visual kind of way, there must at least be a little of overengineering in the technically kind of aspect. problem being of course, I have no clue how js does its evils and I really don't want to get to involved with all the web-techs. If you look at this website with the inspector you are going to see that there is a function onload that is called amalgamate(), that is pretty much all the shenanigans I learned with js so far. It allows me to slice the website into multiple little chunks, and honestly the performance of it is miserable. It is so utterly slow, it can't possibly be any slower, which is why I am going to prerender all the websites into one html when I am fully done, and possibly automate this kind of stuff with node later, so that I can still have the superior workflow, with lots of little entries instead of one monolithic master.html. <br><br> If you payed even closer attention you might have noticed that the code-formating looks different, and that is because google-prettify is apparently no more. I replaced it with Prism, which honestly kinda looks better anyways, it is not quite a drop in replacement, but it comes pretty close.<br> If you payed even more attention you might have realized that some articles are gone. that is because they consisted mostly of code, and code is best shown off in a repository instead. They added way too much text to the website (kinda like this article really), that contributed nothing to my personal development, and was more or less just a non-binary-blob of data.</p>
