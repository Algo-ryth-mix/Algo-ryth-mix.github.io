    <p>Also check out my awesome teammates! You can find there info on the itch.io page. I had a lot of fun creating this game, mostly because of my great team (It sure as hell wasn't Unity that made me smile). With that big project finally completed I can now focus once more on weird libraries I'd like to finish. </p>
