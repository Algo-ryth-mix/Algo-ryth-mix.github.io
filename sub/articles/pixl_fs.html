    <h1>PIXL FS: Next Gen Virtual Filesystem</h1>
    <p>Im pleased to announce the next piece of my pet-project, pixl_fs.</p>
    <p>First: <i>What is pixl_fs?</i></p>
    <p> pixl_fs is the file/resource management system for LibPixlEngine, it closely resembles a normal filesystem.
        Except it isn't!I think pixl_fs is better demonstrated with the syntax im targeting.
    </p>

    <p>Wait... <i> Targeting ?</i><br><br>
    Yes. pixl_fs is not done yet, the progress is about 50% (caching is still acting up, and the base implementations for providers). I'm currently working on another project so pixl_fs had to be paused for a minute. Also one of my crazy friends has an even crazier idea for cache, and I quote: "Might be interesting to see if a bloom/cuckoo filter might make sense for a simple in cache/not in cache check".<br><br> yes haha, Computer Science.<br>Besides talking gibberish for the mere mortal, he is also thinking about joining in on the fun for pixl_fs, because he really likes the concept!<br> thanks btw. &lt;3<br><br>
        I hope to post an update on progress soon, in the mean time check out <a href="kill-the-data.github.io">"Space Game"</a> aka the reason why nothing gets done as of recently.
