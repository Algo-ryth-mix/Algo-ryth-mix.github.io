    <h3>Not the game, silly!</h3>
    <p> During my time working on Legion-Engine it became blatently obvious
        that networking was not going to become part of the engine any time soon.
        That is mostly to the convoluted nature of networking, but also in part to the 
        fact that we want to do networking right. A good friend of mine told me some
        time ago that if I ever needed to anything with networking I should do it in 
        <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>.

    <h3>What is a Go ?</h3>
    <p>
        There is just one little issue with that statement. I have never before written a single program in Go.
        Naturally I decided to start a small project with it. I feel that there is a certain point in a developers
        life where learning languages becomes easier by just jumping into it, rather than reading a bunch of documentation first.
        (That being said, I don't think I can wrap my head around languages like Clojure with that approach just yet).

        A project I have attempted before in a different language that I thoroughly enjoyed was a simple url shortener.

        I started with a few "Hello World" examples like these:
    </p>
    <pre class="language-go loadgo" id="go/hw.go"></pre>
    <p>
        Now immediately this is pretty alien to me. I actually had to upgrade the syntax highlighter for this
        page, because the best match I got was "clike". One of the immediate quirks of go is that projects are structured in 
        <i>packages</i> which is somewhat nice. While they are great for dependencies, they are a bit of a nightmare to make yourself.
        (especially when you don't want to <i>immediately</i> host them).

        One other thing I am torn on is that the return type and the variable type is trailing.
        I know that a lot of people prefer that and there is strong following to have basically every language be like that. 
        But personally I think it looks and feels ... weird.
    </p>
    <pre class="language-go loadgo" id="go/trailing.go"></pre>
    <p>
        I was not completely convinced that this is the language of the future
        yet, but after all the great things that my friend had to say about it, I at least
        had to give it a good try.
    </p>
    <h3>How to make a crappy url-shortener from scratch</h3>
    <p> A good start is the built in http package. Much like python, it feels like there is a
        package pre-made for everything in go (not quite as bad as js-frameworks, but still impressive).
        http allows you to make a simple file server in about 5 lines of code. Let's start with that
    </p>
    <pre class="language-go loadgo" id="go/simpleserver.go"></pre>
    <p> I am not going to lie, that is pretty nice, with essentially 5 lines of actual code
         we have a server that serves <code>./static/index.html</code> to <code>localhost:8080</code>
         Of course this is nothing incredibly impressive. nginx, apache, node ... heck python can do this
         without any code at all. The nice thing here is that we can other things that aren't files at all.
         Additionally, Go is compiled, which gives use excellent performance (even if all we do is serve
         a single html at this point). Speaking of HTML, what exactly are we serving at this point ?
    </p>
    <pre class="language-html loadhtml" id="html/simpleindex.txt"></pre>
    <p>
        As you can see this is about a simple as it gets. No css, no js, nothing. A simple HTML document with a tiny form.
        Definetly not wining any design awards, but that was not the point. 
    </p>
   <p>
       Lets get to some actual functionality, as you can see the form points to a /shorten endpoint, so we need to implement that.
       This time we are going to make a function instead of a file that provides the html. this way we can also do something else while we are at it
   </p>
   <pre class="language-go loadgo" id="go/server_with_shorten.go"></pre>
   <p>
       Ok that was straight forward. Whenever someone makes a request to /shorten with a long field in the request we generate a new code for it
       and store it in a map. we then craft a little bit of a response, which we write directly to the output and that is it.
   </p>
   <p> Of course we need to display that as well. if you took a closer look at the html we sned you can probably see that we add a new link
       for the user that redirects to <code>r?s=%v</code> where v is the new short code, which means we need to create a new endpoint called "r" that accepts a single parameter "s".<br>
       Let's do that!
   </p>
   <pre class="language-go loadgo" id="go/redirect.go"></pre>
   <p>
       And that is all you need for a super simple url-shortener. 
       The only thing remaining is that you have an actual short domain, otherwise
       you might end up extending urls accidentally instead. Of course the feature set 
       of this url-shortener is a bit crude. I added a little bit more functionality in the 
       repository that I uploaded to github <a href="https://github.com/Algo-ryth-mix/learning-go">here</a>.
