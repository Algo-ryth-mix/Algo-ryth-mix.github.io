          <p>Hi! You landed on my Portfolio Website. My name is Raphael and if that name already intrigues you, you can find out more about myself by just reading on! </p>

            My full Name is Raphael Sebastian Baier. I'm from Austria, which naturally means I speak German and as you can see English. I'm currently studying <i> Creative Media and Game Technologies </i>
            <a href="https://www.saxion.edu/programmes/bachelor/creative-media-and-game-technologies"> at the Saxion Univesity of Applied Sciences</a> in the Netherlands.
            Before that I was a student at the <a href="https://www.werkschulheim.at">Werkschulheim Felbertal</a> where I got my Degree in Mechatronics <a href = "https://www.wko.at/service/w/bildung-lehre/Mechatroniker-fuer-Elektromaschinenbau-und-Automatisierung.html">(more about this here)</a> and received the AHS Matura (educ. Higher School Certificate).

            <p>
              It all started at the 17th of April 1999 ... or so I'm told as I don't have perfect recall of that moment.
              The first few years where mostly boring.
            </p>
            <h3>But suddenly! primary school.</h3>
            <p>
              It turns out I was the quiet kid from day 0, dreaming of becoming an Inventor or alternatively a Train-Driver.<br>
              But sadly my school was not that suitable for the quiet kid (as in not quiet enough).
              So after a year or so my Parents decided to get me into another Primary School in Leopoldskron Moos, a Region by Salzburg in Austria.
              The Time there was mostly a blast, except for the occasional Test in German, which I not only hated because of my terrible Handwriting, but also because German is a Language made by an alien lunatic.
              After some fiddeling with the pencile and a bit of kick-start in the german department I got all of this figured out however (or mostly at least).
              I had a few, but good friends and although we were a weird bunch, we didn't get into too much trouble.
            </p>
            <h3> Tears and Sadness</h3>
            <p>
              You remember from before, when I told you that I wanted to become an inventor?
              It turns out the real live equivalent of that is a mechatronics engineer.
              This Idea of becoming a professsional in the mechatronics field was set in my head like nothing else. (and I can be stuborn)
              The only problem was, the only school (at that time at least) that does mechatronics at the level I was interested in was the Werkschulheim Felbertal. A private boarding-school, ontop of a mountain, in the middle of nowhere. To add insult to injury it also takes 9 instead of the usual 8 years. As you can imagine my parents weren't to keen on that idea. They had a masterplan however; The admission at the WSH works as such: you come around for a week do a bunch of tests and if you succeed you get stuffed into a class with 40 other class-mates of which after the 1st year only 20 or so remain. Out of the 120 or so applicants for each year a mear 15 usually graduate after 9 years. Well well well... not only did I get accepted our class also graduated with 21 people, a few wrong assumptions were made here.
              My first 5 years were mostly calm. We had strong winters and hot summers. I also discovered that I can't ski for nothing. I picked up my first book on programming with 12: "Python for beginners". And a year after that I wanted to work in C++ for whatever reason, that was a daunting task to say the least.
            </p>
            <p>
              The time has come to choose my profession. the WSH had 3 Options: Engineering, Mechatronics and Carpenting. I was of course predetermined, but I also discovered that im an absolute idiot when it comes to working with wood. so the decision was extra easy.
              Mechatronics it was. Soldering is fun. Calculating Resistors not so much, Designing in CAD doing some Machining is neat, but programming... that was where I excelled above all (except for one. Instead of making him my arch-enemy however, he became one of my best friends!).
              I discovered that making a hunk of silicone whatever I told it to was indeed such a thrilling experience to me that I immediately specialized in that.
            </p>
            <h3> Nine Years have passed </h3>
              <p>
                 I graduated with an AHS Matura and as Geselle in Mechatronics (soon to be Meister!),<br>
                 Wrote a halfway decent paper on the Encryption of the Enigma Machine,<br>
                 Crashed my first car,<br>
                 Moved a total of 3 Times with my parents already (including to my school),<br>
                 made lots of friends and<br>
                 lost a few.<br>
               </p>
           <h3> Now what ? </h3>
              <p>
                After a bit of contemplation I started my study at Saxion (moving again, twice!)<br>
                My Parents are still not impressed that I keep disappearing.<br>
                The first year is now nearly over... and im working on stuff that I don't really see the use of (Portfolios and whatnot) and stuff that I quite enjoy.
              </p>
              <p>
                I hope this little excerpt from my life gives you a bit on insight into my person. if you figured out what type of Person I am... would you so kindly send me an email, because I am still trying to figure that out on my own.
